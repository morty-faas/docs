# Deploy Morty on your infrastructure

This page will cover all technical requirements and details in order to successfully set-up a ready-to-use Morty instance.
Morty is very lightweight, but has some minimum requirements as outlined below.

<Callout type="warning">
  The guide provided is intended for use in production-like environments. A separate guide specifically for development environments will be made available in the near future.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

To install Morty, you need to have access to a virtual machine or a bare-metal server with a Linux-based (Debian 11+ for example) distribution and the **x86_64** architecture. Also, please ensure that your version of GLIBC is >= 2.29.

### Remote server

You need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/tree/main#getting-started) installed on the host. You can install those tools using the respective official documentations, or by using the following commands:

**Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
```

**Install [Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/tree/main#getting-started)**:

```bash
mkdir -p firecracker
curl -sL -o firecracker.tgz https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases/download/v1.3.1/firecracker-v1.3.1-x86_64.tgz
tar -xvf firecracker.tgz -C firecracker
sudo mv ./firecracker/release-v1.3.1-x86_64/firecracker-v1.3.1-x86_64 /usr/bin/firecracker
```

### Local machine

<Callout type="info">
  [Morty CLI](https://github.com/morty-faas/cli) is available for all
  architectures.
</Callout>

**Install [Morty CLI](https://github.com/morty-faas/cli)**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://morty-faas.github.io/install-cli.sh | sudo sh
```

## Install RIK

The first step is to deploy a [RIK](https://github.com/rik-org/rik) cluster on your server. [RIK](https://github.com/rik-org/rik) is the orchestrator that will be used by Morty to schedule [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) microVMs.

<Steps>

### Download binaries

You can download the latest RIK binaries from the [releases page of the RIK repository](https://github.com/rik-org/rik/releases/latest). Here, we will install the version `v1.0.0` of RIK.

```bash
# Download the release artifacts
curl -sL "https://github.com/rik-org/rik/releases/download/v1.0.0/rik-v1.0.0-x86_64.tar.gz" --output rik.tar.gz
mkdir -p rik
tar -xvf rik.tar.gz -C rik

# Remove files that will not be useful here
rm -rf rik.tar.gz rik/LICENSE rik/README.md rik/rikctl
```

Now, if you run `tree` in your current directory, you should have something like this into the `rik` folder:

```bash
tree

-- rik
    |-- controller
    |-- riklet
    |-- scheduler

1 directory, 3 files
```

Move those binaries into `/usr/bin` :

```bash
sudo mv ./rik/* /usr/bin
```

### Install components

Now that you have gathered all the RIK components, you need to install them on your system. To do so, we will use systemd services here to run our stack. To install our different components, we will use a `service.tpl` file to make the installation easier. Create this file in your current working directory and place the following content inside :

```bash
# service.tpl
[Unit]
AssertPathExists=${BIN}

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=~
EnvironmentFile=${ENV_FILE}
ExecStart=${BIN} ${ARGS}
Restart=always
NoNewPrivileges=true
RestartSec=3

[Install]
Alias=${NAME}
WantedBy=default.target
```

#### RIK Scheduler

To install the scheduler, use the following command :

```bash
# Generate the service file based on the template
NAME="rik-scheduler" ARGS="" BIN="/usr/bin/scheduler" envsubst < service.tpl | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/rik-scheduler.service

# Enable your service
sudo systemctl enable rik-scheduler
sudo systemctl start rik-scheduler
```

#### RIK Controller

To install the controller, use the following command :

```bash
# Generate the service file based on the template
NAME="rik-controller" ARGS="" BIN="/usr/bin/controller" envsubst < service.tpl | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/rik-controller.service

# Enable and start your service
sudo systemctl enable rik-controller
sudo systemctl start rik-controller
```

#### RIKLET

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The riklet will create some `iptables` rules at boot time. We strongly
  recommend to backup your `iptables` rules in case you need to restore them :

```bash
sudo iptables-save > iptables.rules.old
```

</Callout>

To install the riklet, we will first need to determine the name and the IP of the network interface that is connected to internet. Run the following command to retrieve it :

```bash
export IF_NET=$(ip route get 8.8.8.8 | head -n1 | awk '{print $5}')
export IF_NET_IP=$(ip -f inet addr show "${IF_NET}" | awk '/inet / {print $2}' | cut -d "/" -f 1)
```

You also need to export the path of your `firecracker` binary on the host :

```bash
# If it is on your path, else put the path where you have installed it
export FIRECRACKER_PATH=$(which firecracker)
```

Finally, you need to download a custom linux kernel. It is needed to run Firecracker microVMs:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/riklet/
sudo curl -sL "https://morty-faas.github.io/morty-kernel.bin" --output /etc/riklet/morty-kernel.bin
```

Now, you can run the following command to generate the service file :

```bash
# Generate the service file based on the template
NAME=riklet BIN=/usr/bin/riklet ARGS="--master-ip localhost:4995 --firecracker-path ${FIRECRACKER_PATH} --kernel-path /etc/riklet/morty-kernel.bin --ifnet ${IF_NET} --ifnet-ip ${IF_NET_IP}" envsubst < service.tpl | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/riklet.service

# Enable and start your service
sudo systemctl enable riklet
sudo systemctl start riklet
```

### Verify the installation

Run the following commands to verify that all the services are running:

```bash
systemctl is-active rik-scheduler
systemctl is-active rik-controller
systemctl is-active riklet

# You should have the following output:
active
active
active
```

Now, your RIK cluster API is up and running on http://localhost:5000. You need now to install Morty.

</Steps>

## Install Morty

Now that the orchestrator is successfully installed, we can install and configure Morty.

<Steps>

### Download binaries

You can download the latest Morty binaries from their releases pages on GitHub: [controller and registry](https://github.com/morty-faas/morty/releases/latest). Here, we will install the `v1.0.0` of those components.

```bash
# Download the release artifacts
curl -sL "https://github.com/morty-faas/morty/releases/download/v1.0.0/morty-controller-v1.0.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz" --output controller.tar.gz
curl -sL "https://github.com/morty-faas/morty/releases/download/v1.0.0/morty-registry-v1.0.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz" --output registry.tar.gz

mkdir -p morty
tar -xvf controller.tar.gz -C morty
tar -xvf registry.tar.gz -C morty
```

Now, if you run `tree` in your current directory, you should have something like this into the `rik` folder:

```bash
tree

-- morty
    |-- morty-controller
    |-- morty-registry

1 directory, 2 files
```

Move those binaries into `/usr/bin` :

```bash
sudo mv ./morty/* /usr/bin
```

### Install components

#### Dependencies

First of all, we need to deploy a [MinIO](https://min.io/?utm_term=minio&utm_campaign=MinIO-Search-Google+Build+-+International&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=8976569894&hsa_cam=11154547880&hsa_grp=108939911709&hsa_ad=466333759841&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-301105367935&hsa_kw=minio&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=CjwKCAjw9J2iBhBPEiwAErwpefMN2BO_lfKYbrE08HadeSb7aV3Zi88X42aFv997ADNphFx9KULYnhoCKLYQAvD_BwE) and a [Redis](https://redis.io/) instance to store functions images and function state. To keep this guide as simple as possible, we will use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  For production environments, consider adding security to dependencies such as
  authentication, encryption etc.
</Callout>

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file, and place the following content :

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml

version: "3.8"
services:
  redis:
    container_name: morty.redis
    image: redis:7.0.10-bullseye
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    command: redis-server --save 20 1 --loglevel warning
    volumes:
      - redis:/data

  minio:
    image: bitnami/minio:2023.4.20
    container_name: morty.minio
    restart: "unless-stopped"
    volumes:
      - minio-data:/data
    environment:
      # Do not use those credentials in production
      MINIO_ROOT_USER: minioadmin
      MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: minioadmin
      MINIO_DEFAULT_BUCKETS: "functions"
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
      - "9001:9001"
    healthcheck:
      test: curl -f "http://localhost:9000/minio/health/live
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 20s
      retries: 3

volumes:
  minio-data:
  redis:
```

Now, you can start Redis and MinIO using the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Check that your containers are running:

```bash
docker ps | grep morty

# You should have a similar output
e42670c92ace   redis:7.0.10-bullseye        "docker-entrypoint.s…"   3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes               0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp, :::6379->6379/tcp                       morty.redis
4fd84e9e2923   bitnami/minio:2023.4.20      "/opt/bitnami/script…"   3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes (unhealthy)   0.0.0.0:9000-9001->9000-9001/tcp, :::9000-9001->9000-9001/tcp   morty.minio
```

#### Controller

To install the Morty controller, you need first to create a configuration file in `/etc/morty/controller.yaml`:

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/morty
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/morty/controller.yaml
port: 8080

orchestrator:
  rik:
    cluster: http://${IF_NET_IP}:5000

state:
  redis:
    addr: localhost:6379
EOF
```

Now, you can generate the service file for the Morty controller:

```bash
# Generate the service file based on the template
NAME="morty-controller" BIN="/usr/bin/morty-controller" ARGS="" envsubst < service.tpl | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/morty-controller.service

# Enable your service
sudo systemctl enable morty-controller
sudo systemctl start morty-controller
```

#### Registry

Like the controller, you need to create a configuration file to install the registry. Create a file `/etc/morty-registry/registry.yaml`:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/morty-registry
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/morty-registry/registry.yaml
port: 8081
storage:
  s3:
    endpoint: http://localhost:9000
EOF
```

Also, create an environment in `/etc/morty-registry/env.sh` file for the process. **This step is temporary and will be removed in future versions.**

```bash
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/morty-registry/env.sh
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
EOF
```

Now, you can generate and start your service:

```bash
# Generate the service file based on the template
NAME="morty-registry" ARGS="" BIN="/usr/bin/morty-registry" ENV_FILE="/etc/morty-registry/env.sh" envsubst < service.tpl | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/morty-registry.service

# Enable your service
sudo systemctl enable morty-registry
sudo systemctl start morty-registry
```

### Verify the installation

Run the following commands to verify that all the services are running:

```bash
systemctl is-active morty-controller
systemctl is-active morty-registry

# You should have the following output:
active
active
```

</Steps>

## Check that your Morty instance is up and running

Congratulations, if you read this line, it probably means that you had successfully deployed Morty ! But now, we need to test the instance by creating a simple function using the [Morty CLI](https://github.com/morty-faas/cli).

On your local machine, configure a new context to be able to communicate with your fresh instance. Don't forget to replace `$IP` with the IP address of your server:

```bash
morty config add-context my-morty --controller http://$IP:8080 --registry http://$IP:8081
```

Now, you can create a very basic function from the runtimes:

```bash
# Create the function based on Go runtime
morty fn init --runtime go-1.19 my-first-function

# Build the function before invoking it
morty fn build my-first-function
```

Finally, you can invoke your function :

```bash
morty fn invoke my-first-function
```

If everything is ok, you should have the following output:

```json
{ "message": "Hello, World!" }
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations ! You have successfully installed Morty and ran your first function !
