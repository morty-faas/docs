# Build and deploy your first function

This guide will help you to create your first function using the Morty serverless platform. We apologize, we do not provide at today a sandbox environment where you can play with Morty in seconds. Be sure that it is on our roadmap and we will try to provide you a fully functional Morty environment soon.

## Prerequisites

- A Morty instance up and running. Please refer to the [deployment guide](./deployment.mdx) to deploy Morty on your own infrastructure.
- The [Morty CLI](https://github.com/morty-faas/cli) (>= 1.0.0) must be installed on your machine. You can install it using the following convenience script: 
```bash
curl -fsSL https://morty-faas.github.io/install-cli.sh | sudo sh
```


## Create your first function

In this section, you will create your first function with your favorite language. Morty has a notion of [runtime](./runtimes.mdx). Multiple runtimes can be contributed for one specific language. You can list the available runtimes using the following command: 

```bash
morty runtime list
```

You should have an output like :

```bash
Available runtimes:
- go-1.19
- node-19
- python-3
- rust-1.67
```

Choose your runtime based on what languages you prefer. For the rest of this document, we will use the `go-1.19` runtime. You can find all the runtimes in the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/morty-faas/runtimes) . You can now create a new function based on the chosen runtime:

```bash
morty fn init --runtime go-1.19 morty-quickstart
```

This command will create a directory `morty-quickstart` in your current working directory. This directory contains your function code. You can open it in your favorite IDE or code editor to check the files present. For a `go-1.19` runtime, the folder structure will look like:

```bash
morty-quickstart
├── go.mod
├── handler.go
└── morty.yaml
```

The `morty.yaml` file is a special file that holds the function metadata. **This file should not be removed and should be included in your version control.** The `handler.go` file contains the function code, and the `go.mod` allows you to install external Go modules to empower your function. 

You can customize your function as you want. When the function is ready, you are ready to [build it](#build-the-function).

## Build the function

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This section requires an up and running Morty instance. If you don't have acces to an instance,
  you can deploy your own instance by following the [deployment guide](./deployment.mdx).
</Callout>

In order to build and invoke your functions, you need to define a **context** in your CLI. A **context** is simply a configuration related to a specific Morty instance. Let's configure your context based on the Morty instance you target (replace `${MORTY_CONTROLLER_URL}` and `${MORTY_REGISTRY_URL}` by your own instance URLs) :


```bash
morty config add-context quickstart --gateway ${MORTY_CONTROLLER_URL} --registry ${MORTY_REGISTRY_URL}
```

The added context is now the default context. You can now run the build of your function. The build command will send a build request to the registry, and once the build is done, the function will be provisioned through the controller. Execute the following command to build the function :

<Callout type="info">
  "Provisioned" means that the function was registered into the system but no instance was deployed. The deployment of one or more instances happens during the invocation of a function.
</Callout>

```bash
morty function build morty-quickstart
```

Your function is now ready to be invoked. Execute the following command and let the magic happen !

```bash
morty function invoke morty-quickstart
# output
{"message": "Hello, World!"}
```

Congratulations! You had successfully created and invoked your first function using Morty 🚀.
