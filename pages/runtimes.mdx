# What is a runtime ?

In Morty, a runtime is a re-usable program, written for a specific language, that will be injected into your function build. The runtime must run an HTTP server on the port **3000**, and all incoming requests will be sent to your function.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Currently, Morty supports only runtimes for programming languages that have an
  HTTP server available in their libraries.
</Callout>

Below an example of a runtime for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language:

```rust
use axum::{routing::any, Router};
use std::net::SocketAddr;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new()
        .route("/", any(function::handler))
        .route("/*path", any(function::handler));

    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([0, 0, 0, 0], 3000));
    axum::Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

As you can see, the code is simply an HTTP server using the [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) crate. You can notice that we map the routes `/` and `/*path` to `function::handler`. This implies that at build time, your function code will be injected into the `function` module in the working directory of the runtime.

To make things clearer, let's considerate the following function:

```rust
use axum::{Json, response::IntoResponse, http::StatusCode};
use axum::http::Request;

/// `handler()` is a valid Axum route handler.
/// You can use it like a classic handler in a Axum web application.
/// See https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum for more details.
pub async fn handler(req: Request<axum::body::Body>) -> impl IntoResponse {
    println!("Function invoked with method={} and path={}", req.method(), req.uri());

    (StatusCode::OK, Json("Hello, Rust runtime !"))
}
```

Your final build directory will contain the following elements :

```bash
function/
    Cargo.toml
    handler.rs # Function code
Cargo.toml
main.rs # Runtime code
```
