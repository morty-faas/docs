# What is a function ?

In Morty, a function is a classic programming language function. The only difference is that the function, depending on the [runtime](./runtimes.mdx), will have a defined signature.

For example, a JavaScript function for the default [Node.js runtime](https://github.com/morty-faas/runtimes/tree/main/template/node-19) will look like :

```javascript
exports.handler = async function (req, res) {
  return res.status(200).send(JSON.stringify("My first function !"));
};
```

Let's analyze the function signature :

- `req` is an [Express request](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.app) object, as the runtime use Express to handle its HTTP server.
- `res` is an [Express response](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.app) object, as the runtime use Express to handle its HTTP server.

Like a classic API, you can use those two objects to retrieve information about your incoming request. Also, you have full control on the response you want to return.
