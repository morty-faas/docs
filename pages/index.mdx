# Morty

Morty is a serverless platform that can be deployed on minimal stacks or in the cloud to help you reduce your operational costs. Morty is designed to solve common issues related to security and performance, by running functions in microVMs powered by [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/).

At its core, Morty is a community-driven project that aims to be a perfect place for people interested in cloud and serverless architecture to contribute. Whether you're a software engineer, developer, or simply someone who is interested in cloud and serverless, Morty is maybe a good project for you.

One of the main philosophies behind Morty is to develop a platform that can be easily deployed on private infrastructure, so you can avoid paying for cloud resources when you don't really need them. With Morty, you can deploy and manage serverless applications with ease, regardless of whether you're running it on your own hardware or in the cloud.

Morty was initiated by **DevOps engineering students at Polytech Montpellier, France**, and has since grown to become a powerful and versatile platform for serverless computing. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Morty has everything you need to get started with serverless computing and take your applications to the next level.

Thank you for your interest in Morty, and we look forward to seeing what you can create with our platform!
